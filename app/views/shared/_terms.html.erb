DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES

Hit The Spot provides food and beverage (collectively, “food”) ordering services. The Services involve a communications platform and marketplace that are designed primarily to enable GPS-based food ordering and delivery among (i) individuals or businesses wanting to obtain food via delivery to a GPS-based location or via pick up ("Customers"), (ii) restaurants and similar businesses offering food for sale (“Vendors”), and/or (iii) individuals providing delivery services for such food ("Delivery Contractors"). Customers, Vendors, and Delivery Contractors are all considered "users" of the Services. Food orders requested by Customers through the Services are hereinafter referred to as “Orders.”

GPS-based ordering and delivery of food generally refers to connecting a Customer with Vendors near the Customer’s GPS-enabled mobile device, placing an order from the Customer’s mobile device, and in most cases, delivery of the food by the Vendor or a Delivery Contractor to the location of the Customer’s GPS-enabled mobile device.  In order to provide this part of the Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or mobile platform when you use the Services, including your location and cookie information. Please see our Privacy Policy for more on our use of this information and ability to opt out.  Hit The Spot does not guarantee the accuracy or timeliness of GPS-based deliveries.

Hit The Spot does not sell or control the production of any food produced by Vendors. Vendors are obligated by Hit The Spot to comply with federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, and standards pertaining to food preparation, sale, marketing and safety. However, it is critical for users to understand that Hit The Spot does not in any way independently verify the credentials, representations or products of Vendors, the ingredients or the quality of any products, or that a Vendor is in compliance with applicable laws. Customers must make themselves comfortable through information provided by Vendors on the Services or as requested by Customers directly from the Vendors as to the quality and reliability of the Vendors, as well as to their compliance with applicable laws. Hit The Spot does not in any way guaranty the quality of any food or that any food complies with applicable laws. In addition, a Vendor may represent that food preparation is in accordance with special standards such as "organic," "kosher," "macrobiotic" or allergen-specific standards such as "nut-free," "gluten-free," or "lactose-free." However, Hit The Spot does not independently investigate or verify such representations. Hit The Spot is not liable or responsible for any food or services offered by Vendors that are unhealthy, are the cause of injury, that are otherwise unacceptable to Customers or that do not meet the expectation of Customers in any manner. If applicable, Customers are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of delivery addresses, and Hit The Spot has no liability or responsibility for any such erroneous addresses.

Delivery Contractors are independent contractors of Hit The Spot.  Delivery Contractors are obligated by Hit The Spot to undertake a minimal amount of training and to comply with federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, and standards pertaining to food delivery. However, Hit The Spot does not exercise control or supervision over the quality, timing, legality, method, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of Delivery Contractors, nor of the integrity, responsibility or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any users.

Hit The Spot makes no representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of Orders requested and provided by users identified through the Services whether in public, private, or offline interactions. Hit The Spot does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of this information or any information on the Services.

Fees for various services are described throughout the Services.

Please direct all complaints concerning Vendors or Delivery Contractors to Hit The Spot's attention as indicated on the Services.

ORDERS

All ordering is performed via the Hit The Spot mobile applications or website. Hit The Spot does not directly take part in the interaction between users, i.e., the purchase, sale, preparation and delivery of food and beverages. Users of the Services contract for Orders directly with other users. Hit the Spot will not be a party to any contracts for Orders. Hit the Spot facilitates these contracts by supplying a medium for the identification of Vendors and their offerings, coordination of delivery services if available, and the exchange of money between the Customer, Vendor, and/or Delivery Contractor.

Your receipt of an electronic or other form of Order confirmation does not signify the acceptance of your Order, nor does it constitute confirmation of an offer to sell. Vendors may have the right at any time after receipt of your Order to accept, decline, or limit your Order for any reason, whether or not your credit card has been charged. If your credit card has been charged and your Order is canceled you will receive a prompt refund credit to your account. Once an Order has been placed, it cannot be cancelled by the Customer.

Standard Orders
“Standard Order” means an Order created from a Vendor’s menu that is available through the Services.  For Standard Orders, Customers browse available Vendor menus, build an order, and pick the spot for either delivery or pick-up of the food.  The Vendor or a Delivery Contractor will deliver the food to the Customer at his or her selected location, or, if the Customer has specified, the Customer will pick up the food at the Vendor’s location.

Custom Orders
“Custom Order” means a request by a Customer (via the Services) for a Delivery Contractor to place, pick-up, and deliver a food order from a Vendor that does not participate in the Services. Custom Orders create a contract between the Customer and the Delivery Contractor, without the direct involvement of the Vendor.  Custom Orders should specify the exact name and location of the Vendor, the exact menu items the Customer wants from the Vendor, the desired delivery time and location, and the maximum amount the Customer is willing to pay for the entire Order, plus the current delivery fees indicated in the Services. By submitting the Custom Order, Customer agrees that Hit The Spot may authorize the specified maximum amount on Customer’s credit card. Hit The Spot will send the Custom Order to Delivery Contractors working in the applicable area, if any, each of whom may reply to the Customer and propose to fulfill the Custom Order (with any proposed modifications).  Once terms are agreed to, the Customer must indicate acceptance and initiate the Custom Order via the Services to proceed. The Delivery Contractor will place the food order, pick up the food, and deliver it to the Customer at the agreed-upon location.  Upon delivery, the Customer’s credit card is charged for the actual cost of the entire order, including any applicable delivery fees.

PAYMENT

Payment Terms and Sales Taxes
Customers are usually billed directly by Hit The Spot for their Orders, and "Hit The Spot" will be the name that appears on your payment records, but Hit The Spot will not in any manner be considered the seller of the food or delivery services. Terms of payment are within our sole discretion and, unless otherwise agreed by us in writing, payment must be received by us prior to the acceptance of an Order. By submitting an Order, you authorize Hit The Spot to charge your credit card or other payment method for the full amount of the Order listed on the checkout page plus any applicable delivery fees. Payments for Orders must be paid through the Services, except for any reimbursement expenses that are incurred by a Delivery Vendor in connection with the completion of a Customer Order, which may be paid in cash offline or through the Services.

We accept the major credit cards, and some other methods of payment, for all purchases as indicated in the Services. We may stop accepting any particular method of payment at any time. You represent and warrant that (i) the credit card and payment information you supply to us is true, correct and complete, (ii) charges incurred by you will be honored by your credit card company, and (iii) you will pay charges incurred by you at the posted prices, including all applicable taxes, if any.

Note that your carrier’s standard data and messaging rates may apply to all communications between Hit The Spot and your mobile device for communicating with us, and downloadable content or other material may incur additional charges.

Changes in Products and Pricing
Vendors are constantly updating and revising their offerings of products, and they may discontinue or run out of products and services at any time without notice. To the extent that we provide information on availability of products or services, you should not rely on such information, and we will not be liable for any lack of availability of products or services that you may order through the Services.

All pricing for the products available through the Services is subject to change. For all of our and our Vendor’s prices and products, we reserve the right to make adjustments due to changing market conditions, product discontinuation, manufacturer price changes, errors in advertisements and other extenuating circumstances.

Refund Policy
In the case of problems with your food order, please contact the Vendor directly. If you have not been able to resolve your issue with the Vendor to your satisfaction, or if the problem relates to the delivery services, please contact Hit The Spot and we will try to assist you.
In appropriate cases, if you have already been billed by Hit The Spot, we may in our discretion issue full or partial refunds.

NOTE THAT YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FULL COST OF YOUR ORDER AND YOUR CREDIT CARD OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD WILL BE CHARGED, WHETHER OR NOT YOU RECEIVE THE FOOD, (1) IF YOU ARE NOT PRESENT AT THE DESIGNATED OR AGREED-UPON DELIVERY TIME AND LOCATION, WHETHER A SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATED PHYSICAL ADDRESS OR LOCATION OR THE LOCATION OF YOUR MOBILE DEVICE AS INDICATED BY GPS-BASED TECHNOLOGY, (2) IF WE CANNOT DETECT THE LOCATION OF YOUR MOBILE DEVICE AND YOU DO NOT RESPOND TO ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT YOU BY VOICE OR SMS, OR (3) IF YOU ATTEMPT TO EVADE THE DELIVERY OF YOUR ORDER. CUSTOMERS SHOULD MAKE THEMSELVES EASILY-FOUND, ESPECIALLY IF DELIVERY IS TO A MOBILE-DEVICE LOCATION.

We also will advise the alleged infringer of the DMCA statutory Counter Notification procedure described below by which the alleged infringer may respond to your claim and request that we restore this material.

Counter Notification
If you believe your own copyrighted material has been removed from the Services as a result of mistake or misidentification, you may submit a written counter notification ("Counter Notification") to our Designated Copyright Agent pursuant to DMCA 17 U.S.C. § 512(g)(2) and (3). To be an effective Counter Notification under the DMCA, your Counter Notification must include substantially the following:
Identification of the material that has been removed or disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled.
A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court in which your address is located, or if your address is outside the United States, for any judicial district in which the Hit The Spot is located.
A statement that you will accept service of process from the party that filed the Notification or the party's agent.
Your name, address and telephone number.
A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material in question was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
Your physical or electronic signature.

You may submit your Counter Notification to our Copyright Agent by mail or email as set forth above.

If you send us a valid, written Counter Notification meeting the requirements described above, we will restore your removed or disabled material after 10 business days but no later than 14 business days from the date we receive your Counter Notification, unless our Copyright Agent first receives notice from the party filing the original Notification informing us that such party has filed a court action to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity related to the material in question. Please note that if you materially misrepresent that the disabled or removed content was removed by mistake or misidentification, you may be liable for damages, including costs and attorney's fees. Filing a false Counter Notification constitutes perjury.
